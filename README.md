# Weather #

A clean, modern site for current weather and forecasts.  I built this over the course
of about a week to experiment with asp.net on linux through .net core.  I also wanted
to focus on design elements to get a clean look and feel.

* html
* css (sass/scss)
* javascript (es6)
* angular
* asp.net mvc / WebAPI
* gulp
* linux (ubuntu)
* nginx
* Vagrant
* git (github)
* Visual Studio Code

## Running for dev ##

Soon..
